Test for augmenting pxd files

This project is just for me to test how to use cython to generate an extension
from a pure python module with the use of an augmenting pxd file as described
here:
http://docs.cython.org/src/tutorial/pure.html#augmenting-pxd

I would like to be able to do this as it seems like a good way to maintain a
pure python module along with a cython accelerated version.
